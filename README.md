I am an IT professional with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

My journey as a Technology Specialist and NOC Analyst has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.  Recently, I have completed the Security+ to pursue my passion for technology and Cybersecurity.  The Security+ have prepared me for industry-ready jobs.  My ultimate goal is to become a Security Analyst. This role suits me because I have strong analytical abilities, persistence, eagerness to learn, a can-do attitude, problem-solving skills, and communication skills to address problems and emerging threats.

As of 2025, I passed Security+ and CCNA. I am currently preparing to take the CySA+.
